    "motivations": "I believe everyone should have the opportunity to influence the direction of Cardano, even if they’re not deeply involved in governance. That’s where DReps matter: they help make governance inclusive, accessible, and scalable. I’m committed to representing not just current stakeholders, but also future ones. Over time, I hope more knowledgeable users will step forward as DReps—not just to vote, but to guide others who delegate. We need active contributors and responsible voices to build resilient, decentralized governance. Participating as a DRep is my way of contributing meaningfully to Cardano’s future, by amplifying voices and supporting thoughtful, transparent decision-making.",
    "objectives": "I support Cardano as an independent community member, in full alignment with its Constitution and the DRep Code of Conduct. My objective is to make Cardano more accessible to all—by encouraging clear, structured, and inclusive communication across the ecosystem. I place strong emphasis on decentralized identity (DIDs) and everything related to user sovereignty. I also advocate for meaningful interoperability, both with established communities and with partner chains, as I don’t believe in the idea of a single dominant blockchain. More broadly, I support developments that provide real, long-term value and utility to the Cardano ecosystem. Finally, I stand for a balanced and disciplined budgeting approach that encourages innovation, attracts new participants, and supports long-term ecosystem health through responsible spending and planning.",

    "qualifications": "While I come from outside the blockchain industry, my knowledge comes from rigorous, long-term research grounded in a scientific mindset. I do not take positions lightly—every vote I make is backed by careful study, not assumptions. I've been involved in the Cardano ecosystem for some time, closely following its technical and governance developments. In my professional life, I manage a large team across domains that require technical literacy, strategic thinking, and economic understanding. This broad expertise allows me to assess proposals critically and contribute to the ecosystem with a balanced and well-informed perspective.",
