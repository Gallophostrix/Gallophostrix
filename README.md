# 👋 Hi, I'm Gallophostrix!

## 🌍 About Me

I'm a research-driven contributor with a strong interest in open-source ecosystems, digital identity, and decentralized governance.  
I’m currently a **DRep (Delegated Representative) on Cardano**, actively participating in governance decisions, and I’m also on the path to becoming a **Stake Pool Operator (SPO)**.

I speak **French**, **English**, and **Russian**, and I’m passionate about making blockchain technologies more accessible and transparent for everyone.

## 🔧 Tech & Tools

- 💻 Main language: **Python**
- 🚧 Currently learning: **Rust**, **TypeScript**, **Haskell**

## 💡 Interests

- The **Cardano** ecosystem and on-chain governance
- Decentralized identity (DIDs), zero-knowledge proofs, and privacy tech
- Secure infrastructure, staking, and protocol-level tools
- Long-term sustainability and open collaboration models

## 🛠 Ongoing Goals

- Continue contributing as a **DRep** to Cardano’s governance
- Launch and operate a secure and reliable **Cardano stake pool**
- Build tools that empower users and promote ecosystem resilience

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

Always open to collaboration and discussions around governance, infrastructure, and technical tooling on Cardano and beyond. I'm also looking forward learning as much as possible!
Thanks for stopping by!
